This project was bootstrapped with (https://github.com/burkeholland/express-react-starter).
I used this to figure out running expressJS and reactJS on same port so that it doesn't cause cross origin issues.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## Run in development

Run nodemon server/server.js

run node start in app directory
